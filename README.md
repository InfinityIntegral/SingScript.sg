# SingScript.sg (font for Mathematics and Science)

## About this project

This is a font, NOT A SCRIPTING LANGUAGE.

This is a font modelled after my handwriting supposed to include all Unicode characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane (U+0000 - U+FFFF) used in Mathematics, Science, and related fields. Since only Basic Multilingual Plane characters are included, it works perfectly with QString and QChar.

The font does not support colour, so it does not have emojis. However, some emoji-like characters such as hearts and stars are included. The font uses a em size (maximum possible height of character) of 900, an ascent of 600, and a descent of 300.

All characters in the font are handwritten and copied online by me using the template found in the writingtemplates folder.

The kerningscripts folder contains scripts to automatically apply kerning to a font. There is also a usageinstructions.txt document in that folder which explains how to use the scripts.

The encodingscripts folder contains scripts to bulk edit glyphs in your font file, specifically involving unused glyphs. See the usageinstructions.txt document in that folder for more information.
